# Stock Market Prediction App

This application predicts stock prices using historical data and machine learning models. It is designed for educational and prototyping purposes, providing a simple interface to fetch stock data, train a model, and visualize predictions.

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data using Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Preprocesses and prepares data for modeling
- Trains a simple Linear Regression model (using `scikit-learn`)
- Predicts future stock prices
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices with `matplotlib`
- Easily extensible for more advanced models (e.g., LSTM, portfolio simulation)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Packages: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, yfinance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OxxOrcus/Stock-Market-Prediction-App.git
   cd Stock-Market-Prediction-App
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python stock_predictor.py
   ```

2. Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA) when prompted.
3. The script will fetch data, train the model, and display a plot of actual vs. predicted prices.

## Example

```
Enter stock ticker (e.g., AAPL): AAPL
[*********************100%***********************]  1 of 1 completed
```

A plot window will appear showing the comparison.

## Project Structure

- `stock_predictor.py` — Main script for data fetching, modeling, and visualization
- `requirements.txt` — List of required Python packages
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## Future Improvements

This project can be extended in many ways. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- **Advanced Modeling**: Replace the simple Linear Regression model with more sophisticated models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) using TensorFlow or PyTorch for better temporal analysis.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Implement a real-time dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit to visualize stock prices and predictions as they update.
- **Portfolio Simulation**: Build a feature to simulate a trading portfolio, allowing users to backtest strategies and track hypothetical performance.
- **Technical Analysis Integration**: Incorporate more technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) to enrich the feature set for the model.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate sentiment analysis from news articles or social media (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) to gauge market sentiment and improve prediction accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Add automated hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Develop a full-fledged interactive web application using a framework like Flask or Django, allowing for a richer user experience.
- **Risk Management Features**: Introduce risk management metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Value at Risk (VaR), and portfolio drawdown analysis.
- **Containerization**: Provide a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent and easily reproducible environment for deployment.
